This folder contains trunk version of source code (v1) for running copepod Individual-Based Model (ArcIBM).
Makefile is available for compilation using Intel Fortran compiler ONLY (other compilers such as gfortran DO NOT work).
Pre-installed Netcdf librares are also required.

For ArcIBM details, please refer to our papers:
Feng, Z., R. Ji, R. G. Campbell, C. J. Ashjian, and J. Zhang (2016), Early ice retreat and ocean warming may induce copepod biogeographic boundary shifts in the Arctic Ocean, J. Geophys. Res. Ocean., 121, 6137–6158, doi:10.1002/2016JC011784.

To test run the model, you would need the following files:
(1) an Intel Fortran compiler with OpenMP capability;
(2) a netcdf forcing file (.nc) to provide physical and biological forcing field; 
(3) a namelist file (.nml) to define parameters and provide necessary information; 
(4) a job script file (.sh) for job submission;
